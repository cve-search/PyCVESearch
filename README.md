[![Python application](https://github.com/cve-search/PyCVESearch/actions/workflows/mypy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cve-search/PyCVESearch/actions/workflows/mypy.yml)

**PyCVESearch** is an easy to use wrapper around cve-search, defaulting on https://cve.circl.lu.

This library is based on the work of [Martin Simon](https://github.com/mrsmn/ares) and [Kai Renken](https://github.com/elektrischermoench/ares3).

**Important Note**: The API endpoint has been removed from the public instance due to massive abusive behavior. You can use this API against a local version of CVE Search.
